# Restaurant
This project will be used to learn more python and django at the same time. Due to issues with my db I restarted the project in a new branch. 
The purpose is to have a fully functional website for a restaurant where there will be three types of users: Customer, Staff and Admin. 
Each user will have different permissions with admin having total control over the users and all the restaurant.
I will add a user interface where customers will be able to select a date and see all the tables that are available at that time.
Admin will be able to override reservations, add new tables and add new rooms as well as create users and reservations.
Staff will be only be able to see all reservations and make new ones or cancel previous ones.
